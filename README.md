# Southern-water-corp
Welcome to the Southern Water Corp Python Case Study!
Please note that this case study is composed of two parts â€” Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. 
I looked at different scenarios 
1. Box plot when theres is pump failure and when there is no pump failure 
2. Box plot by keeping outliers and removing outliers 
3. Creating quartiles and inter quartile range
4. Correlations among different variables using heatmaps 
5. Correlations specifically with pump failure 
6. Rolling standard deviation correlations of variables in the form of heatmap 
7. Linear regression model predictions 
8. Validation of the predicted model
